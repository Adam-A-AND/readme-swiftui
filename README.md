# Running The Application
The app was created with XCode. In order to run the application, open the ReadMe.xcodeproj in Xcode. Once this has loaded, you should be able to build & run the application using the play button in the top toolbar of the Xcode window. Make sure you have selected an appropriate device before building the app to have this open in the simulator.

# Using ReadMe
Read me gives you the ability to keep track of all the books you have in your personal library. It's a great way to document all of the books you have as well as your progress on reading them all.

Removing a book from your library or adding it to your finished reading list is quick and easy, thanks to the swipe left & right functionality on the main screen.

You can add new books to your library by hitting 'Add new book' from the main screen. Here, you can add the title & author for the book as well as an image to quickly recognise the book.

When you've finished a book, as well as using the swipe actions, you can add your summaries & key highlights from the book to the record so that you never lose track of these important acknowledgments.
